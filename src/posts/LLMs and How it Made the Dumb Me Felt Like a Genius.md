## Where Does It All Start to Go Down
Lately, with the convenience of LLM in my humble daily life as a student studying Computer Science in some backwater university in Indonesia. I have met with the very idea of not having to lift a single finger to complete an assignment by relying on LLM, namely, the all-time popular, everyone's favorite, and infamous ChatGPT.  It was released in November 22t, 2022, and gain traction quickly, with Indonesia being no exception.

I still recall the first time I used it I felt like having a personal holy grail to solve all kinds of my college assignments without having to think twice about it. Being a freshman, most of my subjects are fundamentals--arguably so easy that I didn't need AI's help to learn them.  But knowing how easy they 'hypothetically' should be made me think, *"Uh, these are some real easy-peasy thingies. I'll just breeze through them with my personal 'holy grail' for now. I'll manage some time to study it later when I need it."*  Little did I know that in the future this would come back bite me in the ass, and the future is now, and my ass hurts so bad.

## "Eh.. Easy, I'll Just Had to Do it This Way, Do that That Way, and--Wait.. What The Fuck?"
It was a Tuesday morning, I attended the first session of my Data Structures class in my second semester. Being the clueless, overconfident fuck that I was, I just slept through the whole lecture and didn't pay any single attention. *"Eh, I'll just learn this with ChatGPT later in the afternoon,"* I thought. Well, unsurprisingly, I didn't manage to do that. And just like that, my tuesday routine for the entire semester is set in stone. How did it go, You ask? What? Linked Lists? What are those? Wait--lemme ask ChatGPT about that real quick.

## The ChatGPT Shortcut: A Double-Edged Sword

The first time I tried to look up Linked Lists on ChatGPT, it felt like magic. I typed in a quick query, got back a perfectly structured explanation, and even some code examples. For a moment, I thought, "Wow, this is amazing! Why would anyone actually go through the trouble of learning this when ChatGPT can just summarize it for me?"

But then came the twist. ChatGPT, in all its glory, has a limited context and sometimes an odd sense of priority when answering. I mean, how the hell did I end up getting a full explanation of the concept of Linked Lists without knowing what a node is in the first place? Or how about that algorithm where I needed a good grasp on recursion but instead got a vague description of a "for loop"? Was this the power of LLMs, or was it a curse in disguise?

The more I relied on it, the more I realized that it didn’t help me learn the foundational concepts needed to tackle the bigger picture. All the shortcuts I took ended up adding more confusion than clarity, and it wasn’t until much later, when things started to feel like a blur of fragmented concepts, that I understood how screwed I really was.

## The Stomach-Churning Revelation

Fast forward to later that semester, the moment I hit my lowest. Data Structures midterm was coming up, and I thought, "Okay, time to actually learn this shit properly." I revisited the Linked List topic—this time, without ChatGPT. I grabbed my old textbook, went through a few tutorials, and found out I had barely retained anything from all the times I just asked AI to do my homework for me. It felt like I had skipped a whole chapter in my textbook, and now, I was playing catch-up with concepts that I should've learned weeks ago.

So, there I was, scrambling to make sense of all the things I thought I'd mastered. Trying to implement an algorithm that should've been simple, but was now just a tangled mess of lines of code that didn't make sense. How did I go from “mastering” data structures in my mind to failing miserably at applying them?

This is where I hit a turning point—one that would make me realize, the shortcut, while tempting, could only take me so far. The reality was that the theoretical knowledge I lacked was starting to show, and it was no longer something that ChatGPT could just fix in a flash.
