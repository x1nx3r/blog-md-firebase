## Where Does It All Start to Go Down
Lately, with the convenience of LLM in my humble daily life as a student studying Computer Science in some backwater university in Indonesia. I have met with the very idea of not having to lift a single finger to complete an assignment by relying on LLM, namely, the all-time popular, everyone's favorite, and infamous ChatGPT.  It was released in November 22t, 2022, and gain traction quickly, with Indonesia being no exception.

I still recall the first time I used it I felt like having a personal holy grail to solve all kinds of my college assignments without having to think twice about it. Being a freshman, most of my subjects are fundamentals--arguably so easy that I didn't need AI's help to learn them.  But knowing how easy they 'hypothetically' should be made me think, *"Uh, these are some real easy-peasy thingies. I'll just breeze through them with my personal 'holy grail' for now. I'll manage some time to study it later when I need it."*  Little did I know that in the future this would come back bite me in the ass, and the future is now, and my ass hurts so bad.

## "Eh.. Easy, I'll Just Had to Do it This Way, Do that That Way, and--Wait.. What The Fuck?"
It was a Tuesday morning, I attended the first session of my Data Structures class in my second semester. Being the clueless, overconfident fuck that I was, I just slept through the whole lecture and didn't pay any single attention. *"Eh, I'll just learn this with ChatGPT later in the afternoon,"* I thought. Well, unsurprisingly, I didn't manage to do that. And just like that, my tuesday routine for the entire semester is set in stone. How did it go, You ask? What? Linked Lists? What are those? Wait--lemme ask ChatGPT about that real quick.

## "Wait, I Swear I've Heard About This Before... Just, Like, Never Actually Learned It"

Fast forward to midterm week, and I'm sitting there staring at my laptop screen like it's written in hieroglyphics. The assignment? Implement a balanced binary search tree. And there I was, frantically typing into ChatGPT: "how to make AVL tree java please urgent help." The code it spat out looked reasonable enough—variables named properly, nice comments explaining rotations, the whole nine yards. Copy, paste, minor tweaks so it doesn't look *too* obvious, and submit.

The next week rolls around and the professor drops a bomb: "We'll be having a practical exam. No internet, no ChatGPT, just you and your brain against the compiler." That's when I felt it—that cold sweat rolling down my back, the realization that I couldn't tell a tree traversal from a linked list operation if my life depended on it.

## "I'm In Danger, But Like, For Real This Time"

The night before the exam, I had this brilliant plan to cram an entire semester's worth of data structures into my head. *"How hard could it be? ChatGPT explained this stuff to me already, I just need to... remember it all."* Spoiler alert: turns out there's a reason why these courses are spread across months and not condensed into a single panic-fueled all-nighter.

There I was at 3 AM, surrounded by energy drink cans, watching YouTube tutorials at 2x speed, while simultaneously having ChatGPT explain recursion to me for the fifth time. *"Wait, so the function calls itself? But then... when does it stop? Oh god, I'm too tired for this."*

## "The Reckoning: When ChatGPT Can't Save Your Sorry Ass"

Exam day. The lab was quiet except for the sound of keyboards clacking—well, most keyboards. Mine was suspiciously silent as I stared at the question: "Implement a depth-first search algorithm for a graph." My mind went completely blank. No ChatGPT to rescue me, no pre-written code to modify. Just me and the horrifying realization that I had built my entire academic identity on digital sand.

I typed something—anything—just to look busy. `public void dfs(Node start) {// TODO: figure out what the fuck DFS actually is}`. I glanced around the room, watching my classmates type with purpose and direction while I was mentally drafting an email to my parents explaining why I might be changing my major to something less intellectually demanding, like Professional Napping.

In that moment, I understood with crystal clarity that I'd played myself. All those times I'd smugly thought, *"I'm so smart for using AI to do my work,"* had led me straight to this moment of spectacular, undeniable incompetence.

And honestly? I deserved every painful second of it.
